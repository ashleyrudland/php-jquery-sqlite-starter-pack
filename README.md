# PHP jQuery SQLite Starter Pack

This project was inspired by a recent [Lex Fridman podcast featuring Pieter Levels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFtjKbXKqbg), where they discussed the simplicity and effectiveness of using basic tech stacks for building successful products.

## Goal

The main objectives of this repository are:

1. To demystify the use of a simple tech stack consisting of PHP, SQLite, and jQuery.
2. To demonstrate that this straightforward approach can handle scale effectively.

We've achieved impressive results:

- 330,000 writes per second on a Vultr NVMe VPS ($12/mo) - [Live Demo](https://php-nvme.ashleyrudland.com/)
- 180,000 writes per second on a Hetzner entry VPS (â‚¬3.30/mo) - [Live Demo](https://phpboss.ashleyrudland.com/)

## Single File Architecture

One of the key features of this project is that everything runs in a single `index.php` file. This file handles multiple routes:

- `/`: The home page
- `/api/db-test`: Runs and returns the database performance test results
- `/api/get-capacity`: Returns the VPS capacity information
- `/api/up`: A simple endpoint to check if the service is up

To add new routes, simply extend the switch statement in the `index.php` file:

```php
switch ($path) {
case '/your-new-route':
handleYourNewRoute();
break;
// ... existing routes ...
}
function handleYourNewRoute() {
// Your new route logic here
}
```

## Key Features

- Single file (`index.php`) handles all routing and logic
- SQLite database with optimized settings for performance
- Cross-platform VPS capacity detection (works on both Linux and macOS)
- Caching mechanism for database test results
- Simple HTML/CSS with Tailwind CSS for styling
- jQuery for asynchronous API calls and DOM manipulation

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have PHP and SQLite installed on your system
3. Run `php -S localhost:8000` in the project directory
4. Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## Production Deployment

The code includes logic for production deployment:

- Set the `IS_PROD` environment variable to 'y' for production mode
- In production, the SQLite database is stored in `/data/database.sqlite`
- Error reporting is disabled in production for security

## Conclusion

To all the indie hackers out there: may this project inspire you to build great things with simple tools. Remember, it's not always about using the latest and greatest technology, but about solving real problems efficiently.
